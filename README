First you need to run docker-compose up -d
You will take application with filled database by migrations and fixtures

In tests you can find App\Tests\Controller\TransferControllerTest::testDo what can be execute for creating 2 wallets
and transferring money between them

I had some doubts about the following, but i had thoughts about it:
1) BCMatch library can round numbers up, thats why application sometimes calculate commission more than 1.5%
[2200000010000001, '21000000.10000001', 68499999850000, 2100000010000001]
In this test case (from TransferControllerTest) exact commission is 68499999849999.985 and by BCMath it was rounded to up
Im not sure, that we can charge more, than 1.5% from user's wallet

2) OPTIMISTIC or PESSIMISTIC lock. If OPTIMISTIC mode is enabled, than user could have situations, when his transfer
would not be executed, even after several retries. And im not sure about PESSIMISTIC locks, because Wallet is overload entity
and it must be able to get requests. But PESSIMISTIC locks can slow their handling
