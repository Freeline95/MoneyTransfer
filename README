First you need to run docker-compose up -d
You will take application with filled database by migrations and fixtures

In tests you can find App\Tests\Controller\TransferControllerTest::testDo what can be execute for creating 2 wallets
and transferring money between them

What about im not sure, but was thinking:
1) BCMatch library can round numbers up, thats why application sometimes calculate commission more than 1.5%
[2200000010000001, '21000000.10000001', 68499999850000, 2100000010000001]
In this test case (from TransferControllerTest) exact commission is 68499999849999.985 and by BCMath it was rounded to up
Im not sure, that we can debit some more money, than 1.5% from user's wallet

2) OPTIMISTIC or PESSIMISTIC lock. If OPTIMISTIC mode had been enabled, than user could had situations, when his transfer
could not finish, even after retries. And im not sure in PESSIMISTIC locks, because Wallet is overload entity
and it must be able to get requests. But PESSIMISTIC locks can slow their handling
